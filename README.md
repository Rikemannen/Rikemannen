# Hello

I am [Rikemannen](https://github.com/Rikemannen?=what%20did%20you%20expect%3F)! Welcome to my GitHub profile. I (mostly) make nonsense projects that already exist (but I learn stuff from it, somehow).

## 🚀 About Me

* 🧠 Very new, I like knowing stuff, not learning
* 🛠️ I either make a repo to test stuff, or get ashamed of projects and delete them
* 🐧 Arch user btw (not really, I use manjaro)
* 🧙‍♂️ Favorite things: `ctrl + z` and `git reset --hard`

## Cool stats

![Rikemannen's Stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=Rikemannen&theme=prussian&show_icons=true&hide_border=true&count_private=true)

## 📆 Projects

* 💻 [ToDo List](https://github.com/Rikemannen/todo-list) – because of course I do what i should.
* 🧪 [Profile](https://github.com/Rikemannen/Rikemannen) - Does this count?

## 🔧 Skills

```sh
sudo shutdown now
```

* ⌨️ Googling
* 🐍 Python (to some extent)
* 🧪 3D printing plastic dragons (and test models)

## 📲 How to reach me

* 📨 [Email](mailto:rikemannen.rik@gmail.com)
* 📡 Or just [open an issue](https://github.com/Rikemannen) on any of my repos (will probably get my attention easier)
